# Gateways Management System (GMS) Backend - API

The GMS API is a backend application for managing gateways and their associated peripheral devices. It provides a RESTful interface for storing and retrieving information about these devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the GMS API, you'll need the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- MongoDB (version 5.0.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```
https://github.com/jorgelhd94/gateways-backend.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

3. Have Nest CLI installed

```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

4. Up the development database

```
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Configure the environment variables:

- Clone the file `.env.template` and rename the copy to `
.env`

6. Edit the environment variables defined in `.env`

```
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=EsTEeSMisEcretOO32
APP_MODE=DEVELOP # 'DEVELOP' | 'PRODUCTION'
MONGODB_DEVELOP=mongodb://localhost:27017/gatewaysdb
MONGODB_PRODUCTION=mongodb+srv://mongo:mongo@cluster0.3qsyk6t.mongodb.net/gatewaysdb
```

IMPORTANT: The Mongo DB Production URI is a real db deploy in the Atlas Cloud Service. To use it, simply change the APP_MODE to **PRODUCTION**.

7. Start the server in development mode:

```
yarn start:dev
```

## API Documentation
The API is fully documented using OpenAPI. You can access the documentation by either running the application locally and visiting http://localhost:3000/api/v1/ or by visiting the temporary hosted version at https://gateways-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1. The documentation provides a detailed description of each endpoint, as well as information about the required parameters and expected responses.

**IMPORTANT**: The API use the prefix *api/v1*

The GMS API provides the following endpoints:

### Gateways
* `GET /gateways`: Returns a list of all gateways and their associated devices.
* `POST /gateways`: Adds a new gateway to the database.
* `GET /gateways/:id`: Returns information about a specific gateway and its associated devices.
* `PATCH /gateways/:id`: Updates an existing gateway in the database.
* `DELETE /gateways/:id`: Deletes a gateway and its associated devices from the database.

### Devices
* `GET /devices`: Returns a list of all devices.
* `POST /devices/:gatewayId`: Adds a new device to a specific gateway.
* `GET /devices/:gatewayId`: Returns a gateway with a list of all its devices.
* `GET /devices/:gatewayId/:deviceId`: Returns one device of a specified gateway.
* `PATCH /devices/:gatewayI/:deviceId`: Updates an existing device associated with a specific gateway.
* `DELETE /devices/:deviceId`: Deletes a device.


## Authentication
The GMS API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To access any of the endpoints, you'll need to include a valid JWT in the Authorization header of your requests.

To obtain a JWT, you'll need to make a POST request to the **/auth/login** endpoint with your email and password. The API will return a JWT, which you can then use to make requests to the other endpoints.

### Auth Endpoints
* `POST /auth/login`: Login with email and password.
* `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
* `GET /auth/access`: Verify if an user have a valid JWT.

## Tests
To run the tests for the GMS API, use the following command:
```
yarn test
```

## Deployment
1. Create a public folder in the root directory of the project.
2. Build the frontend application by following the instructions in the: [GMS Client Repository](https://github.com/jorgelhd94/gateways-frontend).
3. Copy all the files located inside the `/dist` folder generated by the client application to the `public` folder created in step 1.
4. Run the following command to build the server application:
```
yarn build
```
5. Deploy the application to your preferred hosting environment.
Before deploying to production, you may want to update the configuration files with the appropriate values for your environment. The application can be configured using environment variables or a .env file in the root directory of the project.

## Temporary Hosting
This application is temporarily hosted at https://gateways-backend-production.up.railway.app/ until March 1st.

## Built With
* Node.js
* NestJS
* MongoDB
* Passport/JWT
